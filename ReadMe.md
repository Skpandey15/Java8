1. What are the core principles of functional programming, and how are they implemented in Java?
   Answer:
   Functional programming emphasizes:

First-Class and Higher-Order Functions: Functions are treated as values that can be passed around or returned. Java achieves this via lambda expressions and method references.
Pure Functions: Functions that produce the same output for the same input without side effects.
Immutability: Data is not modified after creation, which improves thread safety. Java supports immutability through final classes, unmodifiable collections, and immutable data types.
Declarative Style: Code describes what to do rather than how to do it. Javaâ€™s Streams API is a great example, allowing operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing in a fluent, declarative manner.
